Installing
==========
Copying the `phpcassa` directory into your path should be enough to
begin using **phpcassa**. You should be able to import phpcassa
similarly to the following:

.. code-block:: php

    require_once('phpcassa/connection.php');
    require_once('phpcassa/columnfamily.php');

C Extension
-----------
The C extension is crucial for phpcassa's performance.

You need to configure and make to be able to use the C extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd thrift/ext/thrift_protocol
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Add the following line to your php.ini file:

::

    extension=thrift_protocol.so
