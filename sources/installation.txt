Installing
==========
Copying the `phpcassa` directory into your path should be enough to
begin using **phpcassa**.  

You can import the modules by including the following lines:

.. code-block:: php

    include_once('phpcassa/connection.php');
    include_once('phpcassa/columnfamily.php');

This will not automatically allow the
C extension to be used, though.

C Extension
-----------
The C extension is crucial for phpcassa's performance.

You need to configure and make to be able to use the C extension:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd thrift/ext/thrift_protocol
    phpize
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

You need to have a PHP 5 dev package installed in order to do this.  On
Debian-derived systems, the package is named 'php5-dev' and on Red Hat-derived
systems it is 'php-devel'.

You need to add the following line to your php.ini file:

::

    extension=thrift_protocol.so
